13. Is K sensitive to outliers?

The K-means clustering algorithm is sensitive to outliers, because a mean is easily influenced by extreme values. K-medoids clustering is a variant of K-means that is more robust to noises and outliers. 
Instead of using the mean point as the center of a cluster, K-medoids uses an actual point in the cluster to represent it.

14. Why is K means better?

K-means is the simplest. To implement and to run. All you need to do is choose "k" and run it a number of times.
Most more clever algorithms (in particular the good ones) are much harder to implement efficiently (you'll see factors of 100x in runtime differences) and have much more parameters to set.
Plus, most people don't need quality clusters. They actually are happy with anything remotely working for them. 
Plus, they don't really know what to do when they had more complex clusters. K-means, which models clusters using the simplest model ever - a centroid - is exactly what they need
massive data reduction to centroids.

15. Is K means a deterministic algorithm?

No, The basic k-means clustering is based on a non-deterministic algorithm. This means that running the algorithm several times on the same data, 
could give different results.
